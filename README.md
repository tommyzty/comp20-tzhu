# comp20-tzhu
COMP 20 Fall 2016 Private Repo for Tommy Zhu

# The purpose of this Git repository
Holds my assignments and lab codes of COMP20 Web Development

# My favorite lab or assignment
My favorite assignment was the MBTA google map assignment. I've always wanted to learn how to use APIs and implement geolocation,
and this assignment had both of them. It was really fun, and it was the first time that I felt I've built something people can use in real life. 
  
# How much I have grown from day 1 of this course to now
I didn't have any knowledge of web programming before I took this course. I didn't even know what html tags do. Now I have a pretty good
understanding of how the web works and how to make a good web application. 

# The most important thing that I learned in this course
1) Always pay attention to details. This is especially important in web programming because sometimes javascript won't report my mistake, 
and I would end up spending hours trying to figure out what went wrong. Like in the mbta assignment, at first I couldn't get "my location"
pin to show up, and after an hour of debugging I realized I mistakenly wrote "=" instead of "==" in an if statement, which messed up
the location data. 
2) Pay huge attention to security. I learned a lot from doing assignment 4. I never realized how important security was until I started
hacking my partner's code. There are so many ways to mess up someone else's work and steal their private data. To be a good developer, 
I need to make programs that customers can rely on. 

# Topic that I'd like to delve deeper into
Security. But I think Ming's security class will cover it.
