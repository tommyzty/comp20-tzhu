Project: Assignment 2 MBTA Google map API

Successfully built a web page that shows the Boston MBTA red line's location, stop information and my location using the google map API and MBTA API.

Aprroximately 5 hours were used to complete this assignment. 

I used the Haversine Formula to calculate distance between two locations with longitude and latitude, 
based on this website: http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html

I also referred to Ming Chow's ajax's example, available at: https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/ajax/messages.html
